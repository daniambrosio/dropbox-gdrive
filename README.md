# dropbox-gdrive
Compare folders and their files in dropbox and google drive. 
The purpose of these python modules is to call APIs from Dropbox and Google Drive, in order to get a list of files from both services and compare them.

As a matter of fact, it will consider dropbox as the base list and try to find those files in Google Drive.

## Module files
**merge.py** - This module will look in current directory for the csv files (dropbox.csv and gdrive.csv), load them, extract the important data and as a result will create two files cotaining the resulting analysis: *merged.csv* will contain all the files from dropbox that were found in gdrive and *notfound.csv* obsiously will contain the files that were not.
**dropboxreader.py** - This module will connect to dropbox using the provided key and generate the dropbox.csv containing all the files and their data.
**gdrivereader.py** - This module will connect to Google Drive after opening a browser for authentication and generate the gdrive.csv containing all the files and their data.
